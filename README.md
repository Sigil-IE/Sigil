[A New Playerâ€™s Guide to Installing and Playing Mods](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player%E2%80%99s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods/)

Steam or GOG users that want to install a WeiDU mod on anything that includes Siege of Dragonspear must first run [DLC Merger](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/71305/mod-dlc-merger-merge-steam-gog-sod-dlc-or-custom-dlcs-with-the-main-game).

The categories are not meant to be used as install orders (see the wiki for a possible future scope expansion materials), just to organize the mods, hence some mods appear in multiple categories.

The descriptions are broad overviews, always read the mod's page and/or readme for the details. Some mods change too many things or give too many options to fully list in a few sentences. Many mods are broken up into components, some of which may be skipped, but here they are presented collectively.

**Adding a new mod**

Check that the mod link is alive and match the template below, omitting alternative download locations or forums or sites as needed. Underscores are purely for ease of selection, Title Case is prescriptive. Write a one to two sentence description yourself if the one provided by the mod author is too long. The description should be light on adjectives and heavy on quantifiers. Place the mod in an appropriate game and category (may add to multiple, but try for as few as possible). The category may be carried over from BWS if in doubt.

Some mods that have been tested to work on EET, but have not yet been added to the compatibility list are present.
